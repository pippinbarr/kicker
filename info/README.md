## Description
Kicker was written in [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) (version 7.8 - Hydrogen - 7.6.5 build 6G60) and is based on an idea concocted at dinner with [Doug Wilson](http://doougle.net/) and [Simon Christiansen](http://simonsjournal.wordpress.com/). See the game's "walkthrough" for testers' names, bless them all.
