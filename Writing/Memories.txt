YOUTH? - Playground - "I guess I'll go to college"?

HAND - Library basement - writing on hand - haunted? - closing eyes - trying to work out what the letters are (but already knowing given it's a memory) - books and gloom and deserted - 

SCAR - Throwing football with mother endlessly - maybe the scratch tackle - a scar you still have

BALL - Catching touchdowns onto the bed

Reading Don Quixote on the Eiffel tower
