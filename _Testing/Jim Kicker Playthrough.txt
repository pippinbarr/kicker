In this game you interact by typing commands that express what you want to do. The available commands are very simple, such as "get cup" or "kick ball".

When there is a specific, football related command you should type to perform your job as a kicker, the command will appear in bold text so that you know it's important. You should probably do it immediately.

Other than that, you could try all kinds of actions, usually by typing a verb and then an object. Some of the actions you can try include look/examine, sit, stand, get, drop, talk to, drink, touch, taste, smell, and listen.

You can even just watch the game if you want.

You'll figure it out.

The Field
You find yourself standing on the field of play at the 76 yard line. Refreshingly, everyone is paying attention to you. The crowd looms all around you, largely silent as they wait for you to signal your kick.

You can see the special teams unit, some officials and the opposition here.

The holder calmly watches for your signal.

>signal kick
I only understood you as far as wanting to signal.

>signal
You raise your arm to signal you're going to kick to the holder. He turns and signals to the center who fires the ball back. The holder deftly catches it and positions the ball. The two lines of players collide with huge force as they fight to control the space. Now you just need to kick the ball.

>kick
You stride forward and swing your foot into the ball, lifting it toward the goal posts.

You didn't connect well enough and the ball sails wide of the right goalpost. It's no good! The coach waves at you to get off the field.

The crowd stirs restlessly.

The defense runs onto the field. The field goal team runs off the field.

>get off field
But you aren't on the field judge at the moment.

Now would be a good time to run off the field.

>run off field
You wander off.

The Sidelines
Ah yes, the sidelines. The place where you spend almost all of your time. The ground is a little muddy and the benches are almost vindictively  uncomfortable, but it is what it is. There's a bunch of equipment around and as always it's crowded with teammates, coaches, and assorted hangers-on.

You can see the special teams unit, the offensive unit, the punter, the head coach, the special teams coach, some assistant coaches, a film crew, some cheerleaders and an equipment manager here.

>sit
(On the bench.)

You find an empty spot on the bench and sit down. None of your neighbours look very happy about it.
